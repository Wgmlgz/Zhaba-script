# Compiler

You can run zhaba-script programs in 3 ways:

1. Translate to C and run C program.
2. Run program directly throw bytecode.
3. Use [online complier](https://wgmlgz.github.io/zhaba/) without any installation and setup.

If you choose first 2 ways you can use `zhaba` binary to do that.
By default `zhaba` will translate your program to C (to a temporary file `zhaba_tmp.c`) and run it with `gcc`, if you don't want to do that you can set `B` flag and run bytecode directly.

## zhaba binary usage

```console
zhaba <filename>.zh [flags]
```

## Flags

To activate any flag prefix it with `--`, like that: `zhaba test.zh --show_bytecode --B`

| Flag              | What it does                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B                 | Switched compiler to generate and run bytecode                          |
| pure              | Doesn't show compile and runtime logs (only program output)             |
| tokens            | Dumps tokens info                                                       |
| show_ast          | Dumps abstract syntax tree                                              |
| show_st           | Dumps syntax tree                                                       |
| show_st_cool      | Dumps syntax tree like 'real' tree (unusable in big programs)           |
| show_original     | Dumps original program                                                  |
| show_preprocessed | Dumps preprocessed program                                              |
| exp_parser_logs   | Dumps expression logs (for debugging only)                              |
| show_c            | Dumps C code if (only not `B`)                                          |
| show_bytecode     | Dumps generated bytecode (`B` only)                                     |
| stack_trace       | Dumps stack and bytecode operations while program is running (`B` only) |
